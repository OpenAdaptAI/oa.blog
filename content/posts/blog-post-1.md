If you’ve spent any amount of time working with computers, you’ve probably experienced a problem endemic to most forms of knowledge work.

Across an incredibly broad swath of industries, it’s the same fundamental scenario: you are doing a job. There is some critical sequence of tasks, that, while relatively simple, requires you to perform an extremely repetitive sequence of reading the contents of your screen, moving your mouse, clicking a button, and (possibly) doing a little bit of typing. 

While simple, this sequence of tasks is nonetheless extremely important and cannot be automated because you are using a clunky software program that does not have an API and whose content cannot easily be manipulated by your resident data scientist or machine learning engineer. 

You spend an inordinate amount of time continuously navigating a (seemingly endless) loop of repetitive actions in a Graphical User Interface (GUI), watching the hours turn into days and weeks and years, trapped in a Sisyphean pixellated loop inside of your monitor.

Millions of people all over the world are doing this, and they are doing it every single day. 

Whether you’re working in the insurance industry, healthcare, business administration, or virtually any other form of knowledge work, the GUI is the standard interface that allows humans to interact with computers.

It is also extremely constraining. 

All kinds of enterprise software systems—not just legacy systems—lack an API that would otherwise enable automation of repetitive workflows. For these software systems, the GUI is the only portal through which the data inside can be moved or manipulated. In practice, this is like trying to move

People have tried to solve this problem. They’ve built [Robotic  Process Automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation), which attempts to teach computers to manipulate GUI’s and automate these repetitive workflows.

The problem with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is that it *sucks*. It’s a crappy, largely broken technology with a failure rate so high that existing deployments typically require a massive mechanical turk staffed by legions of humans to step in and intervene on a frequent basis due to its inherent fragility.

It’s closer to *outsourcing* the problem than it is to *solving* it. In practice, the core technical problem—automating repetitive workflows in GUI’s—remains mostly unsolved.

Until now.

**OpenAdapt is an open source tool for automating repetitive workflows in GUI’s <u>that actually works.</u>**

Here’s what’s changed: the advent of a new generation of [foundation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models) that are powering the powerful new AI products like GPT-4. 

Here is where the semantics become confusing—when most people think of GPT-4 (and all of it’s incredibly impressive capabilities), they’re thinking of them solely as LLM’s (“Large Language Models”). They think, fundamentally, that these models are *linguistic* in nature.

This is wrong.

GPT-4 and LLM’s in general are a type of *foundation model*.

And it turns out that *foundation models can do all sorts of things, not just predicting the next word in an answer.* They are extremely powerful, generalizable *cognitive engines*: simply put, they can be *analogized* to brains. 

Question: Can foundation models automate repetitive workflows in GUI’s?

Answer: In the same way that your brain cannot move a mouse without an arm attached to it, a foundation model cannot manipulate a GUI’s right “out-of-the box” without the software equivalent of an “arm” that can view and manipulate a GUI.

In principle, your arm is like an “adaptor”—it connects the cognitive engine of your brain to actions in the real world. 

It turns out that a foundational model *also* have an adaptor? Can it have the software equivalent of an arm?

**Yes: OpenAdapt is an adaptor that connects foundational models to GUI’s—connecting the “brain” of a foundational model to the “GUI” of a software program.**

Open Adapt is <u>substantially superior to existing Robotic Process Automation</u> tools. It is based on open source software that can be applied to any repetitive workflow in a GUI, and its performance substantially exceeds that of existing competitors. Its failure rate is a small fraction of existing RPA

Spanning the breadth of all industries where workers are burdened by repetitive tasks in GUIs, the applications are virtually too numerous to count, so we’ll be breaking them up into future blog posts as we race towards the release of our MVP. 

The myth of Sisyphus need not resonate in perpetuity.

OpenAdapt has the capability to end this type of tedium for all workers, everywhere, definitively.
